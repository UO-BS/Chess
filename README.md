# Chess
This is code for the game of console chess that I have created without the use of any tutorials.

I have included (or plan to include) not only the standard game of chess but also some form of custom mode.
In this custom mode the user would be able to create a custom board size and place pieces in chosen locations.

To run the game: Compile the src files and run the Menu class. The console prompts should guide you through the rest.
I plan to change this to simply running a .exe file in the future

Note about playerList: 
You may notice that the Player objects are stored in a list (which could be strange considering that theres only 2 players). 
This should allow for more players or non-player-characters to be added to the custom mode in a future update.

Any suggestions or tips are welcome.
