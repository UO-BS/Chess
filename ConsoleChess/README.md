# Chess
This is code for the game of console chess that I have created without the use of any tutorials.

I have included not only the standard game of chess but also a custom mode and chess960.
In this custom mode the user can create a custom board size and place pieces in chosen locations.

To run the game: Compile the src files and run the Menu class
I plan to change this to simply running a .exe file in the future

Note about playerList: 
You may notice that the Player objects are stored in a list (which could be strange considering that theres only 2 players). 
This should allow for more players or non-player-characters to be added to the custom mode in a future update.

Any suggestions or tips are welcome.
