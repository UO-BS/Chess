# Chess
This is my first Java program with a GUI, a game of Chess.

I have included not only the standard game of chess but also a custom mode and chess960.
In this custom mode the user can create a custom board size and place pieces in chosen locations.

To run the game:
Requirement: JRE 11 or newer (It may work on some older versions).

Method 1) Download then compile the files in the src folder and run the Menu class (Don't forget to download the textures)

Method 2) Download and run the ChessWithGUI.jar file

Note 2022-05-25: Chess960 castling is not available at this time

Any suggestions or tips are welcome.
